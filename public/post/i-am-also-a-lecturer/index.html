<h3 id="once-upon-a-time">Once upon a time&hellip;</h3>
<p>after being a professional developer for almost 3 years, and tasks are being repeated. I felt like I was on a whormwhole of my thoughts. Suddenly, I became burnout.</p>
<p>Ever heared about <code>Programmers Burnout</code>? I thought that was just a myth or something that ain&rsquo;t real. But like any other developers who struggle on it. I struggled on it. I looked for ways to overcome burnout and teaching came to my mind first. Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a school near to our house, ofcourse it&rsquo;s a new environment and also lower paycheck. As in, very low paycheck.</p>
<h3 id="heres-an-example-math-of-how-low-the-paycheck-was">Here&rsquo;s an example math of how low the paycheck was:</h3>
<p>Let us say, my previous salary was 18,000 in peso. Denotes
<code>Sp = 18000</code> and my teaching job was <code>Sp/2</code></p>
<p>Solve:</p>
<p>C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->p<!-- raw HTML omitted --> = S<!-- raw HTML omitted -->p<!-- raw HTML omitted --> / 2</p>
<p>I better not compute it still hurt even though it&rsquo;s 3 years ago now. But I leared alot during in that 1 year of teaching, and it opened alot of opportunity for me. That the lives of the students rely sometimes on the teachers. Teachers can <strong>inspire</strong> or <strong>destroy</strong> they&rsquo;re lives. It is crazy to think but that is true.</p>
