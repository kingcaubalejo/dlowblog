When I was in high school, I started liking programming a lot. I learned to make a special file called a "shutdown" file. It was like a magic button! I put it on our school's Facebook page, and when someone clicked it, their computer would turn off after a minute. I thought I was a super hacker!

But now that I'm older, I realize it wasn't really hacking, just a silly trick. Still, that little prank got me interested in programming. And now, I'm a software engineer, making all sorts of cool stuff with computers! So that's how I got started, and the rest is history!
