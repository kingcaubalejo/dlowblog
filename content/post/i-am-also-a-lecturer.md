### Once upon a time...

after being a professional developer for almost 3 years, and tasks are being repeated. I felt like I was on a whormwhole of my thoughts. Suddenly, I became burnout.

Ever heared about `Programmers Burnout`? I thought that was just a myth or something that ain't real. But like any other developers who struggle on it. I struggled on it. I looked for ways to overcome burnout and teaching came to my mind first. Fortunately, there's a school near to our house, ofcourse it's a new environment and also lower paycheck. As in, very low paycheck.

### Here's an example math of how low the paycheck was:

Let us say, my previous salary was 18,000 in peso. Denotes
`Sp = 18000` and my teaching job was `Sp/2`

Solve:

C<sup>p</sup> = S<sup>p</sup> / 2

I better not compute it still hurt even though it's 3 years ago now. But I leared alot during in that 1 year of teaching, and it opened alot of opportunity for me. That the lives of the students rely sometimes on the teachers. Teachers can **inspire** or **destroy** they're lives. It is crazy to think but that is true.
