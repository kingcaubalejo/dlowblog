#### Introduction

Hi there, 2024 is closing and an increment of 1 will open. It's been a crazy ride in my career and as a human being. There are
some few highlights that I would like to mention before this year closes.

## Don't Rush Things

I mean, rush package manager is quite odd if you are a bias with npm. But hey, it's not about tech! I realized that I always
want to do things in rush. Learning new tech, Programming Language, domain, and many more. In the beginning I thought I am
making progress but little do I know, I am rushing and it makes things slower. So don't rush it, event if it is a production issue, shhhh!

## I got married

Fun fact, I don't like English. Not because I can't speak and write it, I just find it difficult. And fortunately, I married an English major. And from the time I am writing this, she will for sure check the grammar of this blogpost.


## I am a Christian and believes in the Message

I stand on my faith, and will die with it.

## What's next?

No one knows what the future holds. Only Him knows what's next. As they say, don't fight the current. To be honest, I have alot of dreams and ambitions. But knowing that I won't carry it to my grave makes me think of it. But I will be selfish if I will not do something for others.

Other highlights.

1. Lay-off knocked on my door.
2. Down to my last peso.
3. Struggling emotionally.
4. Impostor syndrome.
