#### Introduction

Hi there, 2024 is closing and an increment of 1 will open. It's been a crazy ride in my career and as a human being. There are
some few highlights that I would like to mention before this year closes.

#### Don't Rush Things

I mean, rush package manager is quite odd if you are a bias with npm. But hey, it’s not about tech! I realized that I always want to do things in rush. I haste in learning new tech, programming language, different domains, and many more. In the beginning, I thought I was making progress, but little did I know, I am rushing and it makes things slower. Breaking into tech is not an easy path to take. It’s a vast ocean of different possibilities. Rowing your boat without any direction is worse than failing with direction.

#### I got married

Fun fact, I don’t like English. Not because I can’t speak and write it, I just find it difficult. Fortunately, I married an English subject teacher. From the time I began writing this, she will for sure check the grammar of this blogpost. The wedding preparation was tremendously difficult. I can’t help but say “Thank God” as we have successfully pulled it off. This is the most significant thing that happened to me this 2024. 


#### I am a Christian and believes in the Message

I stand on my faith, and will die with it.

#### What's next?

No one knows what the future holds. Only Him knows what’s next. As they say, don’t fight the current. To be honest, I have a lot of dreams and ambitions. However, knowing that I won’t carry it to my grave makes me think more about it. But I will be selfish if I will not do something for others.

#### Other highlights.

1. Lay-off knocked on my door.
2. Down to my last peso.
3. Struggling emotionally.
4. Impostor syndrome.

Nonetheless, 2024 has been a great ride. And will expect more this 2025. To God be the Glory!
