For the past three months of being inactive in posting, I realized how fast time flies. I participated in some activities at our local church. We created an online registration system, and I designed its infrastructure. We heavily depend on AWS as the infrastructure is purely based on AWS services. I can't show you the images or the design because, currently, I don't know how to.

I opened a [ticket](https://github.com/austingebauer/devise/issues/34) issue to the author of the theme that I am using and hopefully I get a reply, you'll notice if I got some answers If my posts will have some pictures on it.

## What do we expect?


Nothing much, maybe I'll post some tutorials. I'm currently working on a side project and looking for other things to do besides engineering software. To give you an overview, I am looking forward to creating a series of development projects from scratch and making a course. However, due to skill issues, I need to put those plans on hold and study one thing at a time. Until then, consuming text-based content will be my priority as I don't really want to expose my face.

Anyways, will keep writing until internet expires. Cheers!
