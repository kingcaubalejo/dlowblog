## A Serious Headache

I perform like a solutions architect with a backend engineer day-to-day job. Also doing some documentations, yeah I know some of us hate docus, that allow me to walk any engineer through a feature I am working on. Currently I program in a serverless framework using nodejs. And I was tasked to do a multiple file uploading because the previous maintainer
did not do it for some reason. And we are having multiple issues about our single file uploading. That's on top of the "priority" tasks they've mentioned.

I started researching about it and how I can integrate it to serverless framework. Where in a single lambda function could handle a hard limit 10 mb of data in total at once or single invocation.
